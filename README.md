# AdventureWork Case Study using SQL
This AdventureWorks SQL case study showcases my proficiency in database querying and analysis using Microsoft SQL Server. The queries were designed to extract valuable insights from sales and return data, covering aspects such as yearly sales trends, monthly order and return amounts, product performance, and return rates.

## Highlights:

Utilized SQL to modify table structures, optimize data storage, and perform complex data analysis.
Extracted yearly sales quantities for 2015, 2016, and 2017, and conducted detailed monthly analysis for 2016.
Identified bottom 3 products with the lowest sales quantity in each country and top 3 products with the highest return quantity in 2016.
Calculated return percentages for each product and compiled orders with return information for specific months in 2016.
This project demonstrates my ability to manipulate and analyze large datasets, derive meaningful insights, and present findings effectively. The code is well-commented and structured, making it accessible for others to understand and replicate the analysis.# SQL_Case_Study
